# Facial Recognition
Using ~3200 images I'm going to first **try** and generate a composite "face" filter
to help classify whether an image contains a face or not.

If this goes well I want to also test and see if I can determine the difference 
between different faces, for even deeper precision. 

We'll see what happens lol
