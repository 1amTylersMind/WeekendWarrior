# Weekend Warrior
Working during the week doesn't leave me as much time to mess around 
as I would like. Making this space to manage the little projects I mess with 
on the weekends. 

# reporter.py
This is a python script that enumerates the name, IP address and MAC address
 of the local machine in addition to the ip addresses of all machines on the local
 network. I also wrote this because I wanted to compare how much faster it is to
 accomplish this task with a single scapy command, compared with an exhaustive
 ping search (the trade of being the arp command creates very noticeable network
 traffic compared to the quiter pings).
